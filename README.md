## About

**Preventive strike** is my top-down shooter written in python that was inspired by Doom and Hotline Miami and Crimsonland games.

## Running

#### Requirements
* [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/),
* [pygame-menu](https://pypi.org/project/pygame-menu/),
* [pyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)

You can install deps by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

#### Soundtrack

Unfortunately, you can't hear original soundtrack cause of copyright, but you can create your own soundtrack instead.

To upload your own music to the game just copy any `*.ogg` files to soundtrack folder.

I strongly recommend you to find original music and enjoy the game on 100%. By the way it was:

1. Mick Gordon - The Only Thing They Fear Is You
1. Master Boot Record - ANSI.SYS
1. Master Boot Record - Gopher
1. M|O|O|N - Hydrogen

#### Usage

Run `python3 main.py`
